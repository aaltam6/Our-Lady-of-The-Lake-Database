# Our Lady of The Lake Database
1.	Project Statement:
The following report and accompanying database are a mock response to a hypothetical need for a modernized and overhauled database system at Our Lady of The Lake Regional Medical Center.
Originally this idea was proposed and executed by Team Yellow in ISDS 3110 as part of coursework at LSU.
However, this document and the accompanying database were created independently of this course to allow me to develop a more involved solution. There is no significant carryover from one project to the other.
